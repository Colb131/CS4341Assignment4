# CS 4341 - Assignment 4 - Reinforcement Learning
## Mary Braen, Colby Frechette, David Leandres

## To Run
Place desired file in the src folder.

Our program takes 4 arguments

qlearning [**The name of the file to read in representing the map** ] [**How long to learn (in seconds)**] [**The probability of moving in the desired direction upon taking an action**] [**The constant reward for each action**]

## Output
Our program outputs the solution by displaying the optimal state to navigate to from each state.

## Credits
We would like to attribute credit to Github user [technobium](https://github.com/technobium) for the Q-Learning algorithm base implementation that we utilized. We used this as the basis for our repository from which we modified to fulfill the expectations of the assignment. [REPO](https://github.com/technobium/q-learning-java)
